This board is equipped with a single RS-232 connector. The lines
TXD, RXD, RTS, and CTS are connected (via level shifters) to the
FPGA. Because in another project, two serial lines were required
(and no hardware flow control was necessary), the signals RTS and
CTS were used as TXD and RXD, respectively, in a separate (third)
connector. In this way the single serial line with flow control
has been split into two serial lines without flow control. The
constraints file given here uses the second TXD line as output
for the logic analyzer. This can be changed to the original TXD
line by specifying "rs232_txd,Output,PIN_G9,8,B8_N2,3.3-V LVTTL,"
instead of "rs232_txd,Output,PIN_G14,8,B8_N0,3.3-V LVTTL," in the
constraints file. Don't forget to import this file (lfsr128.csv);
otherwise the new assigments would not become effective.
